<span class="s0">SeleniumLibrary</span>
<span class="s0">===============</span>

<span class="s0">.. contents::</span>

<span class="s0">Introduction</span>
<span class="s0">------------</span>

<span class="s0">SeleniumLibrary_ is a web testing library for `Robot Framework`_ that</span>
<span class="s0">utilizes the Selenium_ tool internally. The project is hosted on GitHub_</span>
<span class="s0">and downloads can be found from PyPI_.</span>

<span class="s0">SeleniumLibrary currently works with Selenium 4. It supports Python 3.8 through 3.13.</span>
<span class="s0">In addition to the normal Python_ interpreter, it works also</span>
<span class="s0">with PyPy_.</span>

<span class="s0">SeleniumLibrary is based on the &quot;old SeleniumLibrary&quot; that was forked to</span>
<span class="s0">Selenium2Library and then later renamed back to SeleniumLibrary.</span>
<span class="s0">See the `VERSIONS.rst`_ for more information about different versions and the</span>
<span class="s0">overall project history.</span>

<span class="s0">Keyword Documentation</span>
<span class="s0">---------------------</span>
<span class="s0">See `keyword documentation`_ for available keywords and more information</span>
<span class="s0">about the library in general.</span>

<span class="s0">Installation</span>
<span class="s0">------------</span>

<span class="s0">The recommended installation method is using pip_::</span>

    <span class="s0">pip install --upgrade robotframework-seleniumlibrary</span>

<span class="s0">Running this command installs also the latest Selenium and Robot Framework</span>
<span class="s0">versions, but you still need to install `browser drivers`_ separately.</span>
<span class="s0">The ``--upgrade`` option can be omitted when installing the library for the</span>
<span class="s0">first time.</span>

<span class="s0">It is possible to install directly from the GitHub_ repository. To install</span>
<span class="s0">latest source from the master branch, use this command::</span>

    <span class="s0">pip install git+https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary.git</span>

<span class="s0">Please note that installation will take some time, because ``pip`` will</span>
<span class="s0">clone the SeleniumLibrary_ project to a temporary directory and then</span>
<span class="s0">perform the installation.</span>

<span class="s0">See `Robot Framework installation instructions`_ for detailed information</span>
<span class="s0">about installing Python and Robot Framework itself. For more details about</span>
<span class="s0">using ``pip`` see `its own documentation &lt;pip_&gt;`__.</span>

<span class="s0">Browser drivers</span>
<span class="s0">---------------</span>

<span class="s0">After installing the library, you still need to install browser and</span>
<span class="s0">operating system specific browser drivers for all those browsers you</span>
<span class="s0">want to use in tests. These are the exact same drivers you need to use with</span>
<span class="s0">Selenium also when not using SeleniumLibrary. More information about</span>
<span class="s0">drivers can be found from `Selenium documentation`__.</span>

<span class="s0">The general approach to install a browser driver is downloading a right</span>
<span class="s0">driver, such as ``chromedriver`` for Chrome, and placing it into</span>
<span class="s0">a directory that is in PATH__. Drivers for different browsers</span>
<span class="s0">can be found via Selenium documentation or by using your favorite</span>
<span class="s0">search engine with a search term like ``selenium chrome browser driver``.</span>
<span class="s0">New browser driver versions are released to support features in</span>
<span class="s0">new browsers, fix bug, or otherwise, and you need to keep an eye on them</span>
<span class="s0">to know when to update drivers you use.</span>

<span class="s0">Alternatively, you can use a tool called WebdriverManager__ which can</span>
<span class="s0">find the latest version or when required, any version of appropriate</span>
<span class="s0">webdrivers for you and then download and link/copy it into right</span>
<span class="s0">location. Tool can run on all major operating systems and supports</span>
<span class="s0">downloading of Chrome, Firefox, Opera &amp; Edge webdrivers.</span>

<span class="s0">Here's an example:</span>

<span class="s0">.. code:: bash</span>

      <span class="s0">pip install webdrivermanager</span>
      <span class="s0">webdrivermanager firefox chrome --linkpath /usr/local/bin</span>

<span class="s0">Usage</span>
<span class="s0">-----</span>

<span class="s0">To use SeleniumLibrary in Robot Framework tests, the library needs to</span>
<span class="s0">first be imported using the ``Library`` setting as any other library.</span>
<span class="s0">The library accepts some import time arguments, which are documented</span>
<span class="s0">in the `keyword documentation`_ along with all the keywords provided</span>
<span class="s0">by the library.</span>

<span class="s0">When using Robot Framework, it is generally recommended to write as</span>
<span class="s0">easy-to-understand tests as possible. The keywords provided by</span>
<span class="s0">SeleniumLibrary is pretty low level, though, and often require</span>
<span class="s0">implementation-specific arguments like element locators to be passed</span>
<span class="s0">as arguments. It is thus typically a good idea to write tests using</span>
<span class="s0">Robot Framework's higher-level keywords that utilize SeleniumLibrary</span>
<span class="s0">keywords internally. This is illustrated by the following example</span>
<span class="s0">where SeleniumLibrary keywords like ``Input Text`` are primarily</span>
<span class="s0">used by higher-level keywords like ``Input Username``.</span>

<span class="s0">.. code:: robotframework</span>

<span class="s0">The above example is a slightly modified version of an example in a</span>
<span class="s0">`demo project`_ that illustrates using Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary.</span>
<span class="s0">See the demo for more examples that you can also execute on your own</span>
<span class="s0">machine. For more information about Robot Framework test data syntax in</span>
<span class="s0">general see the `Robot Framework User Guide`_.</span>

<span class="s0">Extending SeleniumLibrary</span>
<span class="s0">-------------------------</span>
<span class="s0">Before creating your own library which extends the ``SeleniumLibrary``, please consider would</span>
<span class="s0">the extension be also useful also for general usage. If it could be useful also for general</span>
<span class="s0">usage, please create a new issue describing the enhancement request and even better if the</span>
<span class="s0">issue is backed up by a pull request.</span>

<span class="s0">If the enhancement is not generally useful, example solution is domain specific, then the</span>
<span class="s0">SeleniumLibrary offers public APIs which can be used to build its own plugins and libraries.</span>
<span class="s0">Plugin API allows us to add new keywords, modify existing keywords and modify the internal</span>
<span class="s0">functionality of the library. Also new libraries can be built on top of the</span>
<span class="s0">SeleniumLibrary. Please see `extending documentation`_ for more details about the</span>
<span class="s0">available methods and for examples how the library can be extended.</span>

<span class="s0">Community</span>

<span class="s0">available:</span>
