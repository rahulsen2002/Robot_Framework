<span class="s5"># Some facts about epoll</span>
<span class="s5"># ----------------------</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Internally, an epoll object is sort of like a WeakKeyDictionary where the</span>
<span class="s5"># keys are tuples of (fd number, file object). When you call epoll_ctl, you</span>
<span class="s5"># pass in an fd; that gets converted to an (fd number, file object) tuple by</span>
<span class="s5"># looking up the fd in the process's fd table at the time of the call. When an</span>
<span class="s5"># event happens on the file object, epoll_wait drops the file object part, and</span>
<span class="s5"># just returns the fd number in its event. So from the outside it looks like</span>
<span class="s5"># it's keeping a table of fds, but really it's a bit more complicated. This</span>
<span class="s5"># has some subtle consequences.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># In general, file objects inside the kernel are reference counted. Each entry</span>
<span class="s5"># in a process's fd table holds a strong reference to the corresponding file</span>
<span class="s5"># object, and most operations that use file objects take a temporary strong</span>
<span class="s5"># reference while they're working. So when you call close() on an fd, that</span>
<span class="s5"># might or might not cause the file object to be deallocated -- it depends on</span>
<span class="s5"># whether there are any other references to that file object. Some common ways</span>
<span class="s5"># this can happen:</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># - after calling dup(), you have two fds in the same process referring to the</span>
<span class="s5">#   same file object. Even if you close one fd (= remove that entry from the</span>
<span class="s5">#   fd table), the file object will be kept alive by the other fd.</span>
<span class="s5"># - when calling fork(), the child inherits a copy of the parent's fd table,</span>
<span class="s5">#   so all the file objects get another reference. (But if the fork() is</span>
<span class="s5">#   followed by exec(), then all of the child's fds that have the CLOEXEC flag</span>
<span class="s5">#   set will be closed at that point.)</span>
<span class="s5"># - most syscalls that work on fds take a strong reference to the underlying</span>
<span class="s5">#   file object while they're using it. So there's one thread blocked in</span>
<span class="s5">#   read(fd), and then another thread calls close() on the last fd referring</span>
<span class="s5">#   to that object, the underlying file won't actually be closed until</span>
<span class="s5">#   after read() returns.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># However, epoll does *not* take a reference to any of the file objects in its</span>
<span class="s5"># interest set (that's what makes it similar to a WeakKeyDictionary). File</span>
<span class="s5"># objects inside an epoll interest set will be deallocated if all *other*</span>
<span class="s5"># references to them are closed. And when that happens, the epoll object will</span>
<span class="s5"># automatically deregister that file object and stop reporting events on it.</span>
<span class="s5"># So that's quite handy.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># But, what happens if we do this?</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5">#   fd1 = open(...)</span>
<span class="s5">#   epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd1, ...)</span>
<span class="s5">#   fd2 = dup(fd1)</span>
<span class="s5">#   close(fd1)</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># In this case, the dup() keeps the underlying file object alive, so it</span>
<span class="s5"># remains registered in the epoll object's interest set, as the tuple (fd1,</span>
<span class="s5"># file object). But, fd1 no longer refers to this file object! You might think</span>
<span class="s5"># there was some magic to handle this, but unfortunately no; the consequences</span>
<span class="s5"># are totally predictable from what I said above:</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># If any events occur on the file object, then epoll will report them as</span>
<span class="s5"># happening on fd1, even though that doesn't make sense.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Perhaps we would like to deregister fd1 to stop getting nonsensical events.</span>
<span class="s5"># But how? When we call epoll_ctl, we have to pass an fd number, which will</span>
<span class="s5"># get expanded to an (fd number, file object) tuple. We can't pass fd1,</span>
<span class="s5"># because when epoll_ctl tries to look it up, it won't find our file object.</span>
<span class="s5"># And we can't pass fd2, because that will get expanded to (fd2, file object),</span>
<span class="s5"># which is a different lookup key. In fact, it's *impossible* to de-register</span>
<span class="s5"># this fd!</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># We could even have fd1 get assigned to another file object, and then we can</span>
<span class="s5"># have multiple keys registered simultaneously using the same fd number, like:</span>
<span class="s5"># (fd1, file object 1), (fd1, file object 2). And if events happen on either</span>
<span class="s5"># file object, then epoll will happily report that something happened to</span>
<span class="s5"># &quot;fd1&quot;.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Now here's what makes this especially nasty: suppose the old file object</span>
<span class="s5"># becomes, say, readable. That means that every time we call epoll_wait, it</span>
<span class="s5"># will return immediately to tell us that &quot;fd1&quot; is readable. Normally, we</span>
<span class="s5"># would handle this by de-registering fd1, waking up the corresponding call to</span>
<span class="s5"># wait_readable, then the user will call read() or recv() or something, and</span>
<span class="s5"># we're fine. But if this happens on a stale fd where we can't remove the</span>
<span class="s5"># registration, then we might get stuck in a state where epoll_wait *always*</span>
<span class="s5"># returns immediately, so our event loop becomes unable to sleep, and now our</span>
<span class="s5"># program is burning 100% of the CPU doing nothing, with no way out.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># What does this mean for Trio?</span>
<span class="s5"># -----------------------------</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Since we don't control the user's code, we have no way to guarantee that we</span>
<span class="s5"># don't get stuck with stale fd's in our epoll interest set. For example, a</span>
<span class="s5"># user could call wait_readable(fd) in one task, and then while that's</span>
<span class="s5"># running, they might close(fd) from another task. In this situation, they're</span>
<span class="s5"># *supposed* to call notify_closing(fd) to let us know what's happening, so we</span>
<span class="s5"># can interrupt the wait_readable() call and avoid getting into this mess. And</span>
<span class="s5"># that's the only thing that can possibly work correctly in all cases. But</span>
<span class="s5"># sometimes user code has bugs. So if this does happen, we'd like to degrade</span>
<span class="s5"># gracefully, and survive without corrupting Trio's internal state or</span>
<span class="s5"># otherwise causing the whole program to explode messily.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Our solution: we always use EPOLLONESHOT. This way, we might get *one*</span>
<span class="s5"># spurious event on a stale fd, but then epoll will automatically silence it</span>
<span class="s5"># until we explicitly say that we want more events... and if we have a stale</span>
<span class="s5"># fd, then we actually can't re-enable it! So we can't get stuck in an</span>
<span class="s5"># infinite busy-loop. If there's a stale fd hanging around, then it might</span>
<span class="s5"># cause a spurious `BusyResourceError`, or cause one wait_* call to return</span>
<span class="s5"># before it should have... but in general, the wait_* functions are allowed to</span>
<span class="s5"># have some spurious wakeups; the user code will just attempt the operation,</span>
<span class="s5"># get EWOULDBLOCK, and call wait_* again. And the program as a whole will</span>
<span class="s5"># survive, any exceptions will propagate, etc.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># As a bonus, EPOLLONESHOT also saves us having to explicitly deregister fds</span>
<span class="s5"># on the normal wakeup path, so it's a bit more efficient in general.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># However, EPOLLONESHOT has a few trade-offs to consider:</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># First, you can't combine EPOLLONESHOT with EPOLLEXCLUSIVE. This is a bit sad</span>
<span class="s5"># in one somewhat rare case: if you have a multi-process server where a group</span>
<span class="s5"># of processes all share the same listening socket, then EPOLLEXCLUSIVE can be</span>
<span class="s5"># used to avoid &quot;thundering herd&quot; problems when a new connection comes in. But</span>
<span class="s5"># this isn't too bad. It's not clear if EPOLLEXCLUSIVE even works for us</span>
<span class="s5"># anyway:</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5">#   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41582560/how-does-epolls-epollexclusive-mode-interact-with-level-triggering</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># And it's not clear that EPOLLEXCLUSIVE is a great approach either:</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5">#   https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing/</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># And if we do need to support this, we could always add support through some</span>
<span class="s5"># more-specialized API in the future. So this isn't a blocker to using</span>
<span class="s5"># EPOLLONESHOT.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Second, EPOLLONESHOT does not actually *deregister* the fd after delivering</span>
<span class="s5"># an event (EPOLL_CTL_DEL). Instead, it keeps the fd registered, but</span>
<span class="s5"># effectively does an EPOLL_CTL_MOD to set the fd's interest flags to</span>
<span class="s5"># all-zeros. So we could still end up with an fd hanging around in the</span>
<span class="s5"># interest set for a long time, even if we're not using it.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Fortunately, this isn't a problem, because it's only a weak reference – if</span>
<span class="s5"># we have a stale fd that's been silenced by EPOLLONESHOT, then it wastes a</span>
<span class="s5"># tiny bit of kernel memory remembering this fd that can never be revived, but</span>
<span class="s5"># when the underlying file object is eventually closed, that memory will be</span>
<span class="s5"># reclaimed. So that's OK.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># The other issue is that when someone calls wait_*, using EPOLLONESHOT means</span>
<span class="s5"># that if we have ever waited for this fd before, we have to use EPOLL_CTL_MOD</span>
<span class="s5"># to re-enable it; but if it's a new fd, we have to use EPOLL_CTL_ADD. How do</span>
<span class="s5"># we know which one to use? There's no reasonable way to track which fds are</span>
<span class="s5"># currently registered -- remember, we're assuming the user might have gone</span>
<span class="s5"># and rearranged their fds without telling us!</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># Fortunately, this also has a simple solution: if we wait on a socket or</span>
<span class="s5"># other fd once, then we'll probably wait on it lots of times. And the epoll</span>
<span class="s5"># object itself knows which fds it already has registered. So when an fd comes</span>
<span class="s5"># in, we optimistically assume that it's been waited on before, and try doing</span>
<span class="s5"># EPOLL_CTL_MOD. And if that fails with an ENOENT error, then we try again</span>
<span class="s5"># with EPOLL_CTL_ADD.</span>
<span class="s5">#</span>
<span class="s5"># So that's why this code is the way it is. And now you know more than you</span>
<span class="s5"># wanted to about how epoll works.</span>

        On Unix systems, ``fd`` must either be an integer file descriptor,

        though the exact semantics will depend on your kernel. For example, 
        this probably won't do anything useful for on-disk files. 
 
        On Windows systems, ``fd`` must either be an integer ``SOCKET`` 
        handle, or else an object with a ``.fileno()`` method which returns 
        an integer ``SOCKET`` handle. File descriptors aren't supported,

        Call this before closing a file descriptor (on Unix) or socket (on 
        Windows). This will cause any `wait_readable` or `wait_writable` 
        calls on the given object to immediately wake up and raise 
        `~trio.ClosedResourceError`. 
 
        This doesn't actually close the object – you still have to do that 
        yourself afterwards. Also, you want to be careful to make sure no 
        new tasks start waiting on the object in between when you call this 
        and when it's actually closed. So to close something properly, you 
        usually want to do these steps in order: 
 
        1. Explicitly mark the object as closed, so that any new attempts 
           to use it will abort before they start. 
        2. Call `notify_closing` to wake up any already-existing users. 
        3. Actually close the object. 
 
        It's also possible to do them in a different order if that's more 
        convenient, *but only if* you make sure not to have any checkpoints in 
        between the steps. This way they all happen in a single atomic 
        step, so other tasks won't be able to tell what order they happened 
        in anyway.
