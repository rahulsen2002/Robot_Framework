<pre><span class="s0">A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE</span>
<span class="s0">==========================</span>

<span class="s0">Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting</span>
<span class="s0">Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands</span>
<span class="s0">as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's</span>
<span class="s0">principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</span>

<span class="s0">In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for</span>
<span class="s0">National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)</span>
<span class="s0">in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the</span>
<span class="s0">software.</span>

<span class="s0">In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to</span>
<span class="s0">BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same</span>
<span class="s0">year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became</span>
<span class="s0">Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see</span>
<span class="s0">https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization</span>
<span class="s0">created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.</span>
<span class="s0">Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.</span>

<span class="s0">All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for</span>
<span class="s0">the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python</span>
<span class="s0">releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes</span>
<span class="s0">the various releases.</span>

    <span class="s0">Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-</span>
                    <span class="s0">from                                compatible? (1)</span>

    <span class="s0">0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes</span>
    <span class="s0">1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes</span>
    <span class="s0">1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no</span>
    <span class="s0">2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no</span>
    <span class="s0">1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)</span>
    <span class="s0">2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no</span>
    <span class="s0">2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes</span>
    <span class="s0">2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes</span>
    <span class="s0">2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes</span>
    <span class="s0">2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes</span>
    <span class="s0">2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes</span>

<span class="s0">Footnotes:</span>

<span class="s0">(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under</span>
    <span class="s0">the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute</span>
    <span class="s0">a modified version without making your changes open source.  The</span>
    <span class="s0">GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with</span>
    <span class="s0">other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.</span>

<span class="s0">(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,</span>
    <span class="s0">because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to</span>
    <span class="s0">CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1</span>
    <span class="s0">is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.</span>

<span class="s0">Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's</span>
<span class="s0">direction to make these releases possible.</span>
