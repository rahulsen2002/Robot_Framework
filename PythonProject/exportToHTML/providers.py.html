        <span class="s3">&quot;&quot;&quot;Produce a sort key for given requirement based on preference. 
 
        As this is a sort key it will be called O(n) times per backtrack 
        step, where n is the number of `identifier`s, if you have a check 
        which is expensive in some sense. E.g. It needs to make O(n) checks 
        per call or takes significant wall clock time, consider using 
        `narrow_requirement_selection` to filter the `identifier`s, which 
        is applied before this sort key is called. 
 
        The preference is defined as &quot;I think this requirement should be 
        resolved first&quot;. The lower the return value is, the more preferred 
        this group of arguments is. 
 
        :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. This 
            identifies the requirement being considered. 
        :param resolutions: Mapping of candidates currently pinned by the 
            resolver. Each key is an identifier, and the value is a candidate. 
            The candidate may conflict with requirements from ``information``. 
        :param candidates: Mapping of each dependency's possible candidates. 
            Each value is an iterator of candidates. 
        :param information: Mapping of requirement information of each package. 
            Each value is an iterator of *requirement information*. 
        :param backtrack_causes: Sequence of *requirement information* that are 
            the requirements that caused the resolver to most recently 
            backtrack. 
 
        A *requirement information* instance is a named tuple with two members: 
 
        * ``requirement`` specifies a requirement contributing to the current 
          list of candidates. 
        * ``parent`` specifies the candidate that provides (depended on) the 
          requirement, or ``None`` to indicate a root requirement. 
 
        The preference could depend on various issues, including (not 
        necessarily in this order): 
 
        * Is this package pinned in the current resolution result? 
        * How relaxed is the requirement? Stricter ones should probably be 
          worked on first? (I don't know, actually.) 
        * How many possibilities are there to satisfy this requirement? Those 
          with few left should likely be worked on first, I guess? 
        * Are there any known conflicts for this requirement? We should 
          probably work on those with the most known conflicts. 
 
        A sortable value should be returned (this will be used as the ``key`` 
        parameter of the built-in sorting function). The smaller the value is, 
        the more preferred this requirement is (i.e. the sorting function 
        is called with ``reverse=False``).

        :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. All 
            candidates returned by this method should produce the same 
            identifier. 
        :param requirements: A mapping of requirements that all returned 
            candidates must satisfy. Each key is an identifier, and the value 
            an iterator of requirements for that dependency. 
        :param incompatibilities: A mapping of known incompatibile candidates of 
            each dependency. Each key is an identifier, and the value an 
            iterator of incompatibilities known to the resolver. All 
            incompatibilities *must* be excluded from the return value. 
 
        This should try to get candidates based on the requirements' types. 
        For VCS, local, and archive requirements, the one-and-only match is 
        returned, and for a &quot;named&quot; requirement, the index(es) should be 
        consulted to find concrete candidates for this requirement. 
 
        The return value should produce candidates ordered by preference; the 
        most preferred candidate should come first. The return type may be one 
        of the following: 
 
        * A callable that returns an iterator that yields candidates. 
        * An collection of candidates. 
        * An iterable of candidates. This will be consumed immediately into a 
          list of candidates.

        An optional method to narrow the selection of requirements being 
        considered during resolution. This method is called O(1) time per 
        backtrack step. 
 
        :param identifiers: An iterable of `identifiers` as returned by 
            ``identify()``. These identify all requirements currently being 
            considered. 
        :param resolutions: A mapping of candidates currently pinned by the 
            resolver. Each key is an identifier, and the value is a candidate 
            that may conflict with requirements from ``information``. 
        :param candidates: A mapping of each dependency's possible candidates. 
            Each value is an iterator of candidates. 
        :param information: A mapping of requirement information for each package. 
            Each value is an iterator of *requirement information*. 
        :param backtrack_causes: A sequence of *requirement information* that are 
            the requirements causing the resolver to most recently 
            backtrack. 
 
        A *requirement information* instance is a named tuple with two members: 
 
        * ``requirement`` specifies a requirement contributing to the current 
          list of candidates. 
        * ``parent`` specifies the candidate that provides (is depended on for) 
          the requirement, or ``None`` to indicate a root requirement. 
 
        Must return a non-empty subset of `identifiers`, with the default 
        implementation being to return `identifiers` unchanged. Those `identifiers` 
        will then be passed to the sort key `get_preference` to pick the most 
        prefered requirement to attempt to pin, unless `narrow_requirement_selection` 
        returns only 1 requirement, in which case that will be used without 
        calling the sort key `get_preference`. 
 
        This method is designed to be used by the provider to optimize the 
        dependency resolution, e.g. if a check cost is O(m) and it can be done 
        against all identifiers at once then filtering the requirement selection 
        here will cost O(m) but making it part of the sort key in `get_preference` 
        will cost O(m*n), where n is the number of `identifiers`. 
 
        Returns: 
            Iterable[KT]: A non-empty subset of `identifiers`.
